# Machine learning playground
This is an area where I play with machine learning alogrithms to improve my skills in this field. The methods in the notebooks are not intended to be strictly correct, but help me to understand how things work.

For 3D visualizations, go to the published versions.

Tools used :
 * Python
 * Tensorflow
 * Scikit-Learn

Published version :
 * [Tensorflow MNIST](https://sbrouil.github.io/ml-sandbox/Tensorflow+MNIST.html)
 * [Kaggle MNIST Clustering](https://sbrouil.github.io/ml-sandbox/MNIST+Kaggle+Digit+clusterization+using+KMeans.html)
 * [Digit Clustering with autoencoder](https://sbrouil.github.io/ml-sandbox/Digit+Autoencoder+Clustering.html)
